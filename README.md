A game that I am building and designing using unity, C#, and blender. 
Implementation and design are based on concepts and creative design by Sam Stagner (@ RonkyKong) who is also responsible for some visual assets. 

In unity hub, add the "Change The Game" folder that shares this directory.

RESOURCES - is a place for anything useful that should remain outside of the unity build. i.e. blender files, temporary assets, png/jpegs, references, etc.

Started in December of 2023.
