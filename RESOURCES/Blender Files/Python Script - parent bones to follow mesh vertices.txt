Step 4: You can use this script to add constraints to every bone in your armature. It will add a Track To constraint to every bone, set it to track your mesh and for each bone it will set it to track the vertex group of the same name. It assumes Track Axis: Y and Up: Z are going to work for you.

import bpy

#change to your armature's name
armature = 'Armature'

#change to the name of the mesh parented to the armature
mesh = 'Plane.001'

bones = bpy.data.objects[armature].pose.bones

for bone in bones:
    nc = bone.constraints.new(type='TRACK_TO')
    nc.target = bpy.data.objects[mesh]
    nc.subtarget = bone.name
    nc.track_axis = 'TRACK_Y'
    nc.up_axis = 'UP_Z'
    nc.use_target_z = True

If you mess up you can clear all constraints with

import bpy

#name of your armature
armature = 'Armature'

bones = bpy.data.objects[armature].pose.bones

for bone in bones:
    for constraint in bone.constraints:
        bone.constraints.remove(constraint)
